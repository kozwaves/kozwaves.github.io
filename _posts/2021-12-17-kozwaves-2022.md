The 5th Australasian Conference on Wave Science, KOZWaves, will be held in hybrid virtual-physical mode in Perth, Western Australia, and online, February 9-11 2022, i.e. shortly after the WA border opens on February 5 – see updates below.

<p><b>Conference Format</b></p>
<p>
As previously announced, the conference will run with a flexible philosophy.  We will provide an online platform, but also welcome physical attendance to join local attendees on the beautiful UWA campus where possible.  There will be no registration fee – note that this means that the conference dinner, for example, will be paid individually.  It is now known that the WA border will open (to vaccinated persons) on February 5 – see

Further, according to the details available at present, there will be no capacity limits on our venue or requirement to wear masks at the conference.  There are requirements around testing which differ for domestic and international travellers.

<p>The KOZWaves conference series provides a forum for contemporary research on wave science, promoting interdisciplinary collaborations between Australasian wave scientists, and with international researchers. It focusses on advancing mathematical and numerical techniques across the different branches of wave science, including acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetics and water waves.
