<p>The 5th Australasian Conference on Wave Science, KOZWaves (https://kozwaves.github.io), will be held in hybrid virtual-physical mode in Perth, Western Australia, and on Zoom, February 9-11 2022.  Owing to the significant barriers and uncertainties around travel to Western Australia at present, the conference will run with a flexible philosophy.  We will welcome physical attendance to the beautiful UWA campus where possible (the venue is booked!), with minimal registration costs or formal arrangements to make sure that decisions around travel can be left to the latest possible time.
 
The KOZWaves conference series provides a forum for contemporary research on wave science, promoting interdisciplinary collaborations between Australasian wave scientists, and with international researchers. It focusses on advancing mathematical and numerical techniques across the different branches of wave science, including acoustics, elasticity, electromagnetics and water waves.
 
Abstracts (1 paragraph) may be submitted via email to KOZWaves2022@uwa.edu.au* until 1 December, 2021.  
 
Please feel free to contact us on this address with any queries.
